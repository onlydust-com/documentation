# TBD

We help people contribute to open source. That’s it. Whether you're a contributor looking for something meaningful to build, or a maintainer looking for actual humans to help - not bots - we're here.

### 2025 - Become the "Open Source home"

Up till now, people may have known us as the place to contribute to Web3. That’s not wrong - but it’s not the whole story. In 2025, we wanted to change that perception. We're building the platform to contribute to **open source**, full stop.

We’ve worked to:

* Remove the crypto/web3-only label
* Bring in projects from across the open source universe (infra, frameworks, devtools, AI, etc.)
* Make it easy for any maintainer to get visibility, contributors, and actual help
* Make it easy for any contributor to find a project and a good first issue (without reading 14 outdated READMEs)
* Provide a "matching engine" where contributors are recommended projects based on their skills and interest.
* Show metrics for maintainers: who’s looking at your project, who applied, how experienced they are.
* Have a very simpley onboarding flow that doesn't block.

**If you're talking about open source and onboarding, OnlyDust should be part of that conversation.**
