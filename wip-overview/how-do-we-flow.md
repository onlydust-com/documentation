# How do we flow

A common question we get: how does OnlyDust make money?

The answer is simple: **sponsorships**.\
\
We partner with companies and organizations who want to support open source and reach developers like you. They fund the platform - and we put that funding to work where it matters.

#### Where the Money Goes

We reinvest the majority of sponsorship revenue back into the open source community.

* In 2024, 72% of our income was distributed directly to maintainers and contributors for their work (PR activity and onboarding activity).
* In 2025, this amount goes through our 3-month grant program, supporting long term contributors and maintainers across the space.
* Every month, we add $15,000 of our own budget toward:
  * Exclusive merch
  * Travel and conference grants
  * Event tickets
  * And other meaningful rewards for active contributors

Our goal is to make contributing to open source recognized, supported, and rewarding -not just technically, but financially and personally too.\`
