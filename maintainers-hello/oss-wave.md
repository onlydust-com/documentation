# OSS Wave

The best monthly event ever. Bragging a little bit, but it’s kind of true. It’s a moment in time when maintainers and contributors get together to ship, ship, ship! In just 10 days.

We partner with strong repos that are looking to onboard motivated devs to help them fix their issues quickly.

Over 5500 devs (probably more, can’t keep up!) have joined the Wave and many maintainers have found great long term contributors through this.
