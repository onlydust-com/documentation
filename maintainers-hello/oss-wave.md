# OSS Wave

### What's it about

The best monthly event ever. Bragging a little bit, but it’s kind of true. It’s a moment in time when maintainers and contributors get together to ship, ship, ship! In just 10 days.

We partner with strong repos that are looking to onboard motivated devs to help them fix their issues quickly.

Over 5500 devs & 500 repos (probably more, can’t keep up!) have joined the Wave.

### Why participate?&#x20;

It’s the perfect time to attract motivated devs - contributors know maintainers are actively looking during this period.\
.\
It’s your chance to showcase your repo, onboard talent, and boost progress.

Many maintainers have found long-term contributors through the OSS Wave, which is why we’ve been running it for over a year and a half now!

**Bonus:** participating increases your chances to earn perks like grants and limited-edition merch. ([More info in the grant eligibility](grant-eligibility.md)).

### How it works

_(Have a look at the using the_ [_dashboard section_](using-the-dashboard.md) _on step by step details)._&#x20;

If you have repo(s) that you'd like to have participate in the next Wave, simply register them.

When your repo is accepted, you'll be able to add in the issues you'd like to have contributors help you on (these steps are in the "[Using the dashboard](using-the-dashboard.md)" section).&#x20;

### Now in more detail

When the OSS Wave starts, contributors will be looking at the repos that are participating in the Wave. All this is done through the OSS Wave page.&#x20;

Before it starts, you'll only be seeing this:&#x20;

And boom, when it's live, a whole new page takes action!&#x20;

* The OSS Wave lasts \~10 days.
* We strongly recommend contributors and maintainers stay active and communicative throughout the week.
* To keep things smooth, make sure there's a clear way to reach you - Telegram, Discord, or whatever works best.
* Contributors can submit PRs anytime during the week, but we **highly** recommend they submit all final work (even drafts) by Day 10 to show progress.
* You’ll then have two extra days to review and merge.

Keep us posted along the way. Any frustrations, any questions, or just to say hi.  [Discord](https://discord.gg/sVDvdKqPqN) is the way to go.&#x20;
