### Issues Inbox

Remember, everything is synchronized between GitHub and OnlyDust. So over here, you'll be able to manage your issues, track their progress and assign to the contributor that you think best fits.&#x20;

* You can see those that applied to your issue
* You can see the discussions in the issue&#x20;
* You can filter out the issues you would like to see as well as the repo

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're project is participating in our OSS Wave, you can add the issues you'd like contributors to work on directly here. More info in next section.
{% endhint %}

* You can see the metrics/reputation of the contributors that have applied to your repo. For example with the below you'll be able to see that the contributor is highly recommended.&#x20;

You can also see their pending applications, when they registered on GitHub and their language proficiencies.&#x20;

That way you can make a better decision on whether you want to assign or reject the application.&#x20;

It's a good way to filter out spammers.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:red;">**Important!:**</mark>**&#x20; We highly recommend that you assign a contributor to an issue. It allows the contributor to know that they can start working on it.**&#x20;

* Lastly, you can include issues you'd like to have participate in the OSS Wave. More on what this event is about in the [next section](oss-wave.md).&#x20;

### Pull Requests Inbox

Over here, you'll be able to track the PRs that have been made.&#x20;

What you'll be able to see:

* the link to the PR, the contributor that made the PR and the repo that the PR was made in.&#x20;
* the status of the PR. Is it in progress? In review? What's up?
* when you click on a PR, you'll be taken back onto GitHub to finalize your review and merge or not the PR.
* then, you can filter the PRs according to whether the PRs are still open, merged, in draft mode or those that you have closed. Better tracking!&#x20;

* If you're flooded with PRs, you even have a handy search toolbar to search by title or contributor (author) name.

{% hint style="info" %}
What are the indicators? If the PR is of good quality, if the PR answered the issue at hand, if tests and CI has been passed.
{% endhint %}

### Waves

We'll talk more about the event in the next section, but in one quick sentence: these are monthly online events where you can attract and onboard a number of contributors onto your repo.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 14.17.11.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All you need to do is list your project, go through the steps to select the repos you want involved, fill in the application form and we'll validate if all is good.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:red;">**Special mention:**</mark>**&#x20;During the filling out of the application form, make sure that you choose the category(ies) that most fits your repo. This helps when contributors filter out repos according to the category of their choice.**

Once that is done, you can add issues to the Wave (this brings you back to the Issues inbox). An automatic label will be added to the issues you want for the OSS Wave for better visibility.&#x20;

Then all you need to do is wait till D-Day!&#x20;

We'll be sending out emails and catching up with you on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sVDvdKqPqN) so that you're not alone in the process.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:red;">**FYI:**</mark>**&#x20;If you didn't complete the listing of your project, you'll see on the dashboard that the status shows as "To Complete". Just click on it to go through the process. The Status changes to "Validated" or "Rejected" when it is final.**&#x20;
