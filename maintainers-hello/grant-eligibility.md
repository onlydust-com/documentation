# Grant eligibility

Some projects on OnlyDust may be eligible for grant funding. We work with sponsors who support high-impact open source projects and want to see them grow. Grants can reach up to $5,000 over a period of 3 months, based on:&#x20;

* **Consistent activity**: regular progress on issues, merged PRs, and updates
* **Contributor engagement**: welcoming and onboarding contributors effectively
* **Clear direction**: execution on a roadmap, even if lightweight

We also keep a few grant spots open for promising early-stage projects -especially those that show initiative, strong structure, and responsiveness.

### How to increase your chances

Participation and visibility go hand-in-hand. Here’s what can help you get noticed:&#x20;

* **Join the OSS Wave**: Projects in Waves are featured more prominently and reviewed more frequently
* **Engage with contributors**: Be responsive, present, and communicative during contributor activity
* **Structure your repo (check out the** [**Best Practices section** ](https://app.gitbook.com/o/MQQDjhOXRySQPsao0aZ0/s/FetEvDuVEZkpYJ6kurbf/~/changes/5/contributors-hiya/best-practices)**for more info)**:
  * Write a clear README
  * Maintain a roadmap
  * Label and scope your issues
  * Include onboarding and contribution docs
* **Show that you're active**: Regularly open and close issues, merge PRs, and summarize progress monthly.&#x20;

> **Visibility is earned**, not automatic. We manually review activity and engagement across the platform on a rolling basis.

### What we look for

We assess projects using a combination of visibility signals and contribution quality:

* **Activity**: merged PRs, issue velocity, responsiveness to contributors
* **Structure**: clear roadmap, well-described and tagged issues
* **Community-building**: onboarding, mentoring, and inclusive practices
* **Relevance**: alignment with real-world use cases and ecosystem maturity

Consistent quality and contributor experience matter most.

### New vs. Existing Projects

Being new is not a disadvantage. Mature projects may have more data and traction, but newer projects can rise quickly if they:

* Ship consistently
* Onboard contributors clearly and kindly
* Present a compelling, structured vision

Visibility and funding eligibility are reassessed monthly - if you're not hitting the marks, you can be dropped out.

### Not Eligible Yet? We still have your back

If your project isn’t yet eligible for a grant, you may still benefit from a **Fellow Contributor (more info in the** [**OnlyDust Fellowship** ](https://app.gitbook.com/o/MQQDjhOXRySQPsao0aZ0/s/FetEvDuVEZkpYJ6kurbf/~/changes/5/contributors-hiya/onlydust-fellowship)**section)**.

Fellows are selected developers, funded by OnlyDust, who contribute actively to projects we (and the sponsors) believe in. They bring:

* High-quality engineering support
* Increased project velocity
* Mentorship for other contributors
* A commitment to open source values

Fellows are matched with projects based on skills, needs, and potential impact. We handle the logistics and the introduction - your job is simply to collaborate and integrate them into your team.

### FAQ

**Do top projects get all the funding?**\
Funding is prioritized for top-ranked, high-quality projects, but it's not exclusive. Projects showing consistent growth, strong community engagement, and good structure can still be selected for grants in future cycles.

**How is a “top-ranked” project defined?**\
Through a mix of quantitative signals and manual review, including:

* Contribution history and recent trends
* Roadmap and issue quality
* Contributor onboarding success
* Relevance and real-world utility

**How can smaller or less visible projects attract contributors?**\
Focus on being contributor-friendly:

* Write clear, scoped, and labeled issues
* Respond promptly to PRs and questions
* Offer documentation to onboard newcomers
* BE ACTIVE. In general. Not just during the OSS Wave. Show that you care about your repo.
