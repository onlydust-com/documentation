# How to get started

The process is quite simple (we strive to be).

All you need is your GitHub account. And your repo(s).

Then sign up and go through the very quick and easy onboarding steps.

You will be asked to give GitHub authorizations for synching your organisation(s) & repo(s). We know this looks scary so we made a section ([Why GitHub authorizations](https://app.gitbook.com/o/MQQDjhOXRySQPsao0aZ0/s/FetEvDuVEZkpYJ6kurbf/~/changes/4/maintainers-hello/why-github-authorizations)) regarding that on the next page.

#### The Steps

1. So first connect yourself with your GitHub account.&#x20;
2. Once you've given access to authorize OnlyDust via GitHub, sync the organisation you'd like to have on the platform.
   1. If you don't see you're organisation, add it in. &#x20;

3. Then select the repo(s) you'd like to sync. Hope you like my repo name :wink:. Inside Joke.
   1. If you can't find your repo, you can contact us. Make sure that you are owner of your repo or that you have been granted access by the owner.&#x20;

4. Once that is done, you'll be able to see your cool dashboard.&#x20;
   1. In the "issues inbox" you'll be able to manage your issues, review applicants, track progress. Hence why it's important that you assign your issues!
   2. In the "PR inbox" you can review and merge the PRs directly.&#x20;
   3. In the "Waves" section, you can list your repo(s) to onboard new contributors. [More on this in over here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/MQQDjhOXRySQPsao0aZ0/s/FetEvDuVEZkpYJ6kurbf/~/changes/4/maintainers-hello/oss-wave).
   4. And then we have cool new things coming up :eyes:.

And when you've been all signed up, youâ€™ll get cool emails from our CEO. So that is your first touchpoint. Pretty cool, no?

Your second touchpoint is joining our [community on Discord](https://discord.gg/sVDvdKqPqN).&#x20;
