# Best Practices

We've asked a few maintainers in the space to let us know what they considered is important to attract good devs to their repos. Here are a few of their thoughts:

#### 1. Docs, Docs, Docs

Good documentation is essential for attracting and retaining contributors. Make sure your repo includes:

* A clear and informative README that outlines what your project does and why it matters
* Well-defined contribution guidelines to help newcomers get started
* A codebase overview so contributors can navigate the project confidently
* A project roadmap highlighting priorities and where help is most needed
* Info on how to set things up if needed
* A contact method (email, Discord, Telegram, etc.) for better communication

Basically, the easier it is to understand your project, the more likely others are to contribute.&#x20;

#### 2. Make issues look easy to contribute to

Help contributors help you by preparing your issues properly:

* Label your issues clearly (e.g. `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `frontend`, `bug`)
* Write detailed and specific descriptions
* Keep issues current and relevant

This saves contributors time and lowers the barrier to getting started.

#### 3. Be present & reactive

Visibility matters. You are free to use our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/sVDvdKqPqN) to connect with potential contributors:

* Post about your project, especially during OSS Waves
* Share what kind of profiles youâ€™re looking for (languages, experience levels, etc.)
* Stay responsive and available **-** especially during the first 10 days of an OSS Wave when most contributions happen :eyes:

Also - feedback is also greatly appreciated. Tell the contributor when they've done a good job (always nice to hear!). But equally tell the contributor if they've done something poorly. No one likes to be left hanging.

#### 4. Keep your repo active

An active repo signals a healthy project. Merge PRs when ready, review and respond to issues, and regularly update documentation. Even small signs of activity can help reassure new contributors that their time will be valued.

**5. Assign issues**

Obviously, you can maintain however you want your repo, but we would suggest assigning your issues to contributors. It makes things easier for tracking and for the contributor to know they've been assigned to the issue and can work on it straight away.
