# Who are we

> We help frontier AI labs to make their models & agents better at code generation.&#x20;

Yep, that's us. \
But how did we come to this?&#x20;

#### **2023 - 2025:** Become the "Open Source home"

We've started in 2023 by building a platform to contribute to **open source**.&#x20;

Along the years, we’ve worked to:

* Make it easy for any maintainer to get visibility, contributors, and actual help
* Make it easy for any contributor to find a project and a good first issue (without reading 14 outdated READMEs)
* Provide a "matching engine" where contributors are recommended projects based on their skills and interest.
* Show metrics for maintainers: who’s looking at your project, who applied, how experienced they are.

#### **2025 - now:**&#x20;

_**We spent years mastering something most companies never crack: finding elite developers and funding their best work.**_&#x20;

By 2024, we'd distributed $15M to 400 open source projects, building an expertise in what makes truly exceptional code, and how to fund it without micromanagement.&#x20;

Then we moved to San Francisco, and the top AI labs pulled us aside with a problem:&#x20;

They confessed a hard reality: their coding agents were acing toy benchmarks but failing catastrophically on real-world systems, on the kind of intricate, closed-source, deeply contextual code that OnlyDust’s network lived for.&#x20;

That’s when it clicked.&#x20;

Our community wasn’t just building open-source software, they were unintentionally stress-testing the limits of artificial intelligence.

So we made a bold choice. We reoriented everything toward a new mission: funding engineers whose code breaks AI.&#x20;

Today, OnlyDust (operating under our CtrlG brand for AI labs) partners with the world’s top research teams to turn elite, private codebases into the most rigorous coding benchmarks ever built.

We no longer just fund open source.\
We fund the _impossible_, so machines can one day catch up to human ingenuity.
