# Team & Jobs

#### The Gang

We are a team of 7. There is the growth, finance and the tech team, along with our two co-founders.&#x20;

The tech team has a back-end & front-end devs. All with their very own talents and specialities. They are the ones that help build the product that you see today. And debug in under 30 minutes. Yep, they are that reactive :wink:

The finance team speaks for itself! This is where the team makes sure that we're not financing weird stuff and that those that use our platform are legit users.&#x20;

The growth team is probably the most "visible". They're the ones that are contacting you on a daily basis and making sure everything is going well.  \
\
We are based in San Francisco. \
\
Every month we gather together during our team off-site, because we like each other :) . \


#### Jobs

Currently we do not have any job openings! \
\
But hey, if we do, we will be sure to communicate on it.&#x20;
