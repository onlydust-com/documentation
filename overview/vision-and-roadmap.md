# Vision & Roadmap

We help people contribute to open source. That’s it. Whether you're a contributor looking for something meaningful to build, or a maintainer looking for actual humans to help - not bots - we're here.

### 2025 - Become the "Open Source home"

Up till now, people may have known us as the place to contribute to Web3. That’s not wrong - but it’s not the whole story. In 2025, we wanted to change that perception. We're building the platform to contribute to **open source**, full stop.

We’ve worked to:

* Remove the crypto/web3-only label
* Bring in projects from across the open source universe (infra, frameworks, devtools, AI, etc.)
* Make it easy for any maintainer to get visibility, contributors, and actual help
* Make it easy for any contributor to find a project and a good first issue (without reading 14 outdated READMEs)
* Provide a "matching engine" where contributors are recommended projects based on their skills and interest.
* Show metrics for maintainers: who’s looking at your project, who applied, how experienced they are.
* Have a very simpley onboarding flow that doesn't block.

**If you're talking about open source and onboarding, OnlyDust should be part of that conversation.**

#### What is coming up:

**AI-assisted collaboration (but still human)**

We’re building tools so contributors and maintainers can:

* Understand codebases faster
* Write issues and PRs more confidently
* Use AI to help review and improve contributions
* Delegate repetitive tasks without losing control
* Let contributors define features, set directions, and vote on priorities
* Use agents to implement code, tests, docs, etc.
* Let maintainers orchestrate, guide, and review - with as much or as little control as they want

**Gamification (the good kind)**

Contributing should feel rewarding.

* XP, levels, badges (not just for fun - some perks included)
* Better profiles contributors can show off
* Visible progression tied to actual contributions (not vibes)\


Our end-goal: OnlyDust to become the platform that powers AI-native collaboration. You bring the brains and intent. The machine handles the repetition and boilerplate.&#x20;
