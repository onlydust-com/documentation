# Vision & Roadmap

We help people contribute to open source. That’s it. Whether you're a contributor looking for something meaningful to build, or a maintainer looking for actual humans to help - not bots - we're here.

### 2025 - Become the "Open Source home"

Up till now, people may have known us as the place to contribute to Web3. That’s not wrong - but it’s not the whole story. In 2025, we wanted to change that perception. We're building the platform to contribute to **open source**, full stop.

We’re working to (if not yet done already :wink:):

* Remove the crypto/web3-only label
* Bring in projects from across the open source universe (infra, tooling, devtools, AI, etc.)
* Make it easy for any maintainer to get visibility, contributors, and actual help
* Make it easy for any contributor to find a project and a good first issue (without reading 14 outdated READMEs)

**If you're talking about open source and onboarding, OnlyDust should be part of that conversation.**

#### Key initiatives in 2025:

**1. Matching engine**

Finding a project should take minutes, not weeks. We're building:

* A contributor onboarding flow that doesn’t suck
* A project + issue recommendation system (powered by AI, tastefully)
* Stats for maintainers: who’s looking at your project, who applied, how experienced they are
* A project page that _actually helps_ people decide if they want to contribute

**2. AI-assisted issue creation**

Good issues attract good contributors. But writing them takes time.

* Maintainers will get AI help writing and refining issues
* We’ll suggest issues based on code analysis and PRs
* Support for gating issues by experience, or using “first come, first served” strategies

**3. Gamification (the good kind)**

Contributing should feel rewarding.

* XP, levels, badges (not just for fun—some perks included)
* Better profiles contributors can show off
* Visible progression tied to actual contributions (not vibes)

### 2026 - AI-assisted collaboration (but still human)

We’re building tools so contributors and maintainers can:

* Understand codebases faster
* Write issues and PRs more confidently
* Use AI to help review and improve contributions
* Delegate repetitive tasks without losing control

### 2027 - AI-native open source

This is where we try something bold.

We're building toward projects that:

* Run with a mix of humans and AI agents
* Let contributors define features, set directions, and vote on priorities
* Use agents to implement code, tests, docs, etc.
* Let maintainers orchestrate, guide, and review - with as much or as little control as they want

OnlyDust becomes the **platform that powers AI-native collaboration**. You bring the brains and intent. The machine handles the repetition and boilerplate.&#x20;
