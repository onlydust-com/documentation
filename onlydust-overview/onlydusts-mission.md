# OnlyDust's mission

## Mission

Really simple. We want to be known as the best way to start contributing to open source. When you think of open source, awesome devs, top repos, we want to you to think about OnlyDust.

## Purpose

#### **Why? – Open source collaboration is fragile by nature.**

Open source is built on collaboration at scale - but that collaboration is fragile.

Maintainers want to code, not babysit. They need reliable contributors and fear wasting time on newcomers who disappear after a few PRs. They prioritize long-term commitment for the project’s success. Contributors, on the other hand, want to help, but not at any cost. They need recognition and support, yet they aren’t getting it.

The result? A fragile system where trust erodes as time passes.

#### **Why now? – Open source might not survive the next AI decade**

AI is making everything worse.

Low-skill contributors flood maintainers with bad and AI-generated code, scaling inefficiency to new levels. Maintainers, now coding faster than ever, are tempted to work alone. They don’t even know if they’re talking to humans. No one enjoys it.

Collaboration was already fragile. Now, with improper use and integration of AI in their daily work, it’s barely holding together.

#### **So what? – It’s time to invent AI-native collaboration**

The old model is breaking—we need a new one. Open source won’t survive if we don’t rethink collaboration for the AI era. The future of open source isn’t just AI-assisted coding. It’s AI-native collaboration.

AI should enhance collaboration, not break it. Instead of drowning in low-quality contributions, maintainers need AI-powered agents to filter, refine, and align code with project goals. Instead of random contributors, we need AI-driven matchmaking to connect the right people to the right projects.

OnlyDust takes the essential dust of what made open source collaboration great - the particles that truly count, only the dust that matters - to build a new AI-native system where collaboration doesn’t just survive but thrives.

To create a new (GitHub) star, you need only dust.
