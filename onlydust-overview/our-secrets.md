# Our secrets

Soâ€¦the question that often pops up: how do we make money?&#x20;

Thanks to sponsors. We make money because big brands are paying us to have your attention.&#x20;

And what do we do with that?&#x20;

We allocate a very big part (72% last year) through a 3-month grant program to promising OSS contributors and maintainers.

Every month, we add $15k of our own money. For awesome merch. Or travel grants. Or event tickets. Just really good things that are worth it to reward builders.
