# OnlyDust Fellowship

Contributing to open source on OnlyDust can open a lot of doors - if you show up, contribute meaningfully, and stay consistent. The more active and reliable you are, the more visibility you get on the platform, and the more chances you have to earn perks, mentorship, and even funding.

### What is awaiting you

**Exclusive Merch**\
We send out limited-edition merch to contributors who are active and engaged. You’ll get something cool once you start contributing (and merging top PRs) - and if you keep going, you’ll unlock higher-tier drops that reflect your impact in the space.

**Access to Mentors**\
Some contributors gain access to experienced open source developers who can offer technical guidance, review your work, or connect you to opportunities. This can happen online or in person, and in some cases, we’ll even cover your travel and conference ticket if there’s an event worth attending.

**Fellowship Program**\
The Fellowship is our way of supporting top contributors who want to go all-in. It’s a 3-month funding program where selected contributors may receive between $300 and $5,000 per month to keep building in open source.

You need to show consistent, high-quality contributions in open source. Contributing to a project backed by one of our sponsors can increase your chances, but any public repo listed on the platform is fair game.

### How the Fellowship works

Fellows are selected from the pool of the most active and impactful contributors on the platform. There’s no strict formula - but here’s what we look for:

* You’ve been contributing consistently over time
* Your pull requests are well-thought out, scoped, and relevant
* You don’t just write code - you communicate well, collaborate, and improve the project for others
* You’re active on issues, ask the right questions, and respond to feedback

It’s not about having the most PRs. It’s about having quality work done, helping move things forward, and building trust with maintainers and other contributors.\


* We run manual reviews to select Fellows. We look at your full contribution history, including past OSS Waves, and we consider context - not just numbers. If eligible, we'll invite you to a quick call to learn more about your goals and where you want to grow.
* Once selected, you’ll receive funding for up to three months and we’ll help connect you with a project, ecosystem, or organization where you can have impact. **This is reviewed on a monthly basis.**

At the end of the fellowship, you’re free to continue contributing, switch focus, or even launch something of your own. We’ll still support you however we can.

### FAQs

**Do I need to be ranked to get selected for the Fellowship?**\
While we’re working on a quality-based scoring system that can be visible to all, selection is mostly manual and based on the consistency, depth, and relevance of your contributions.

**Will merged PRs matter more?**\
Merged PRs definitely help, but it’s not about just getting merged. What we care about:\
– Is your contribution of high quality?\
– Were maintainers happy with you?\
– Are you helping the project move forward?

**I’m new  - do I have a shot?**\
Absolutely. Some of our most promising contributors were new just weeks before they were selected. If your work is strong, consistent, and well-communicated, you can rise quickly.

**Is there a fixed number of Fellows selected each month?**\
We aim to fund as many contributors as possible based on available sponsor support. We review monthly and rotate fellows every 3 months, so there’s always a new cycle and new opportunities.

**Will my past contributions count?**\
Yes. Your previous PRs, activity during OSS Waves, and overall participation on the platform are part of your contributor history. They help us understand your journey and impact.
