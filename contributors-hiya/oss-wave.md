# OSS Wave

### What's it about

It's THE event of the month that lasts around 10 days.

The Wave is a moment in time when maintainers from a variety of repos create or open a number of issues for contributors to tackle.&#x20;

We partner with strong repos that are looking to onboard motivated devs to help them fix their issues quickly.

Over 5500 devs & 500 repos (probably more, can’t keep up!) have joined the Wave.

### Why participate?&#x20;

It's the perfect time to explore projects across the space, get onboarded, build your skills and be in direct contact with the maintainer.&#x20;

This is when everyone is active and when you can get instant feedback on your work.&#x20;

Many contributors have found amazing projects to contribute to in the long-term, leading them to furthur opportunities.

Basically, great for your resumé :wink:. &#x20;

**Bonus:** Participating increases your chances to earn perks like fellowship grants and limited-edition merch. ([More info in the OnlyDust Fellowship](onlydust-fellowship.md)).

### How it works

_(Have a look at the using the_ [_Find your first issue_](find-your-first-issue.md) _on step by step details)._&#x20;

In order to participate, you will need to register to "Join the Wave".

Before it starts, you'll be seeing a page similar to this:&#x20;

And boom, when it's live, a whole new page takes action!&#x20;

As a contributor, you'll be able to browse through open issues and repos looking for contributions.&#x20;

* You can use the filters that are provided to have a better look at issues that match your skills or repos that interest you.&#x20;
* Once you find an issue that you'd like to tackle, go through the steps in the [_Find your first issue_](find-your-first-issue.md) section.

Other info:&#x20;

* The OSS Wave lasts \~10 days.
* We strongly recommend contributors and maintainers stay active and communicative throughout the week.
* To keep things smooth, make sure you always let maintainers where things are at.
* Contributors can submit PRs anytime during the week, but we **highly** recommend they submit all final work (even drafts) by Day 10 to show progress.
* Maintainers then have two extra days to review and merge.

All info are sent through our mails (so keep an eye out on that) and on our  [Discord](https://discord.gg/sVDvdKqPqN).&#x20;
