# Find your first issue

### Manage your applications & start contributing!

Every month we do a 10-day long sprint where a number of selected projects open up issues for contributors to tackle. This is known as the [OSS Wave](https://app.gitbook.com/o/MQQDjhOXRySQPsao0aZ0/s/FetEvDuVEZkpYJ6kurbf/~/changes/5/contributors-hiya/oss-wave) :ocean:.&#x20;

But if you fancy starting contributing before the event, you can start looking at repos that have open issues ready.

You'll see that with the little bubble which announces how many open issues there are:&#x20;

If you're interested in this repo for example, click on it and you'll see more descriptions of what it's about.

If an issue that is open catches your attention, simply click on it and click on the "I want to work on this issue" button on the left hand side of your screen.&#x20;

You'll be directed to ask for authorizations via GitHub ([read here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/MQQDjhOXRySQPsao0aZ0/s/FetEvDuVEZkpYJ6kurbf/~/changes/5/contributors-hiya/why-github-authorizations) as to what is asked). This is to allow us to be able to synchronize your work on GitHub onto the platform.&#x20;

A window will pop up asking you to apply.&#x20;

Make sure you give details on why you would be a good fit for this issue to up your chances. When you submit your application, the comment will automatically appear on the issue in question in GitHub.

Then wait! If the maintainer thinks you're a good fit, they'll assign you and you'll receive a notification. And then...up to you to work your magic!&#x20;

### Managing your applications

If you want to know the status of your applications and where things are at, we have a very handy dashboard for you.&#x20;

Head over to your bubble head (the icon on the top right of your screen) and click on "**My Applications**".

Over here, you'll be able to view your applications and status.&#x20;

You can see issues that you've been assigned to, those that expecting PRs, in review, closed or completed!&#x20;

Perfect to know where things are at and to jump back into issues that you need to work on.&#x20;

The more you contribute, the more you can be eligible for our [OnlyDust Fellowship](https://app.gitbook.com/o/MQQDjhOXRySQPsao0aZ0/s/FetEvDuVEZkpYJ6kurbf/~/changes/5/contributors-hiya/onlydust-fellowship) program and perks.&#x20;
