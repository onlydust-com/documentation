# How to get started

Easy peasy.&#x20;

All you need is to have your GitHub account and go through quick and easy steps to get yourself started.

1. First, sign up as a contributor.

2. Accept the code of conduct _(won't put a screenshot here as it's boring BUT important to read and accept of course...)._
3. Add in your contact information. We highly recommend to add in the ones that you're okay to be contacted on.
4. Select the languages that you are fluent in. This helps us to recommend repos according to your skills. Super important. If you don't see your language just search for it (we show the most popular ones).

5. Then, select the topics that you like. Whether that's AI, gaming, dev tools...
6. And then voilà! You'll see a personal dashboard with top picks for you, projects that welcome newcomers, or those that are trending in your interests.&#x20;
   1. You can use the section to explore different categories or use our "browse" tab if you want to go further.

And after all this, you’ll get cool emails from our CEO. So that will be your first touchpoint :sunglasses:.

Your second touchpoint is joining our [community on Discord](https://discord.gg/sVDvdKqPqN).&#x20;
