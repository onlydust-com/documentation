# KYC/KYB - ID verification

For those that are eligible to OnlyDust Fellowship or the Grant program we will ask to verify your identity. We don't want to be funding weird things...

## In detail - what it is and what you should know

Before we can reward anything, you need to verify your identity through our compliance partner **Sumsub**.

This is a standard KYC (for individuals) or KYB (for companies) process. It keeps everything clean on both ends - including yours - and helps us comply with international regulations.

We’ve kept it simple, and it usually takes less than 5 minutes if you have the right docs ready.

### If You’re an Individual (KYC)

You’ll be asked to provide:

* A valid ID (passport, national ID card, driver’s license, or residence permit)
* A proof of address dated within the last 3 months
* A selfie
* A short questionnaire asking if you're a US Person (citizen or resident)

**ID Requirements:**

* Must be a live photo of the original document (not a scan or screenshot)
* If your ID has two sides, you must upload both
* Image must be in color, fully visible, and unedited

**Proof of Address Requirements:**

* Must clearly show your full name and address
* Dated within the last 3 months
* Accepted formats: utility bills, bank/credit card statements, or official government documents
* Must be a photo or scan, under 50Mb
* If double-sided, upload both sides

<mark style="background-color:red;">**Important**</mark>**:**

* Screenshots, mobile phone bills, medical bills, receipts, or insurance statements will be rejected.
* If you’re a student living at your parents' home - we accept the following document as POA (Proof of Address):
  * A certificate of accommodation dated less than 3 months and signed by one of the parent _(model below)_.
  * A copy of the CNI (ID Proof) of the signatory (parent)
  * A POA at the name of the signatory (parent) with their name and address on it dated less than 3 months. It can either be a bank statement or a bill.

Model as an example:

_I, \[Name Surname], born on \[date of birth] at \[place of birth], residing at \[your full address] hereby certify on my honor to host at my home, free of charge \[Madam, Mr] \[First Name Last Name], born on \[date of birth] at \[place of birth] of nationality \[country of birth]._

_Done at \[place of declaration] on \[date]_

_Signature_

* _Minimum age to pass KYC is 16_
* _We do not accept applicants from: Cuba, Syria, Iran, North Korea_

### If You’re a Company (KYB)

If you’d rather use a company to receive your payments (which we recommend if you do have one), here’s what you’ll need:

* A Certificate of Incorporation (dated less than 12 months)
* A Shareholder registry or official document that lists your directors and UBOs (anyone owning more than 25% of the company)
  * This can be a recent cap table signed by an authorized person of the company (don’t forget to date it also) or signed official doc
* You may also need to submit additional documents based on your country

<mark style="background-color:red;">Country-specific notes:</mark>

* US: Your EIN is required
* Australia: You’ll need your ACN/ARBN, business address and legal address
* Germany, Ireland, Malta, etc.: Expect to provide details about directors, business activity, and legal rep

#### Final, final tip

We know it’s not the most fun part of the journey, but doing this properly means:

* You get paid safely
* You avoid issues with your local tax office
* And you don’t have to come back later to fix stuff
