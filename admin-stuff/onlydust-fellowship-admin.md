# OnlyDust Fellowship - admin

### What to Expect

Yes, we know - admin stuff isn't what you came here for.

But we’ve kept it simple, clean, and (almost) painless. You'll be receiving each step by email.

Here’s how it works:

#### Step 1: Fill out the onboarding form&#x20;

By email, we’ll ask for:

* Your personal or company info (so we can invoice properly). _If you’ve got a company, use your company details. It’ll make invoicing smoother -  and let’s be honest, your local tax office will give you way less trouble later on._
* The wallet where you want to receive your rewards (make sure to follow the rules that we send you by email along with your Tally form to complete).

#### Step 2: Verify your identity (KYC/KYB)

Once step 1 is completed, you'll receive a link to do a quick identity check with our partner Sumsub.

It takes 3–5 minutes and helps us stay compliant on both sides.

* If you’re an individual → upload your ID, a selfie, and proof of address
* If you’ve got a company → add your business registration + UBO info

Please refer to our [section KYC / KYB](https://app.gitbook.com/o/MQQDjhOXRySQPsao0aZ0/s/FetEvDuVEZkpYJ6kurbf/~/changes/7/admin-stuff/kyc-kyb-id-verification) for more info.

#### Step 3: Sign your Fellowship contract

Identity verified, you’ll get a Pandadoc to sign via email.

This makes it official. No contract = no rewards. Period.

#### Step 4: We issue the invoice for you

No need to create your own - we generate the invoice or receipt on your behalf.

_You’ll get a copy by email for your records._

#### Step 5: Payment time

Once the invoice is ready and your contributions are approved, we process your payment to the wallet you gave us.

It may take up to 7 business days to land.

You’ll get a final email with the transaction hash once it’s done.

If you ever get stuck or don’t receive something, just email us at [**admin@onlydust.xyz**](mailto:admin@onlydust.xyz) .
