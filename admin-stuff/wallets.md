This part is for contributors and maintainers that are eligible to grants.

### How to set up your wallet properly (and not lose :moneybag:)

You’re about to receive a Fellowship grant or a project reward through OnlyDust.

That means you’ll get either crypto payments (USDC or native tokens) if you're contributing to a blockchain ecosystem, or fiat payments (USD/EUR) via PayPal if you're contributing to traditional open source projects (non-blockchain).

Each ecosystem comes with its own network, rules, and currency. So please — read this carefully. Mistakes here can get expensive.

#### Step 1 – Check your ecosystem + currency

Your payment method is determined by OnlyDust based on the ecosystem you’re contributing to - you don’t need to make that decision.

In the onboarding form (Tally), you’ll be asked to provide either a crypto wallet address or a PayPal email, depending on your assigned payment method.

We’ll clearly indicate whether you’ll be paid in crypto or fiat (USD/EUR) — no need to guess, but you won’t be able to choose.

Here’s the breakdown by ecosystem:

**If you're contributing to a traditional OSS project (non-blockchain):**

* You’ll get paid via PayPal
* By default, payments will be made in USD
* If you’re a resident of the European Union, you can choose to be paid in EUR
* Your PayPal account must be valid and verified
* Make sure the email address or the phone you give us is linked to your account

<mark style="background-color:red;">If your PayPal account is in a different currency than the one you're paid in (USD or EUR), PayPal will convert the funds, and you may incur FX fees on your side.</mark>

**If you're in the Starknet ecosystem:**

* Payments are made in USDC
* Network: Starknet
* Wallets we recommend you to use: Braavos or Ready (former ArgentX)
* Your wallet must:
  * Be non-custodial (no exchanges because it might result in loss of funds- it happens a lot with exchange when it comes to USDC)
  * Be activated (you must have received at least 1 STRK once)

**If you're in the Stellar ecosystem:**

* Payments are made in USDC
* Network: Stellar
* Wallets we recommend you to use: LOBSTR or any non-custodial Stellar wallet
* Your wallet must:
  * Be activated (i.e. received at least 1 XLM in the past)
  * Have the USDC asset added manually (refer to your wallet’s FAQ)
  * Not be an exchange wallet — those often have internal routing and will reject or lose USDC

**If you're in the Flare ecosystem:**

* Payments are made in native FLR tokens
* Network: Flare
* Wallets we recommend you to use: Use a EVM compatible wallet such as metamask or Rabby on the Flare Network. Please refer to FLR recommandations here [https://flare.network/wallets](https://flare.network/wallets)
* Same rules apply: no exchange wallets, and make sure the wallet is ready to receive FLR

#### Step 2 – Provide your wallet or PayPal address (correctly)

In the onboarding form, you’ll be asked to share either your wallet address or your PayPal email, depending on your ecosystem (we choose for you, don’t worry).

You have two options:

1. Crypto contributors: use WalletConnect (if supported) or paste your wallet address
2. Traditional OSS contributors: provide your PayPal email or telephone

_Important: double-check what you submit. If you enter a wrong wallet or email and the funds go missing, we can’t recover them._

If you made a mistake, email us ASAP at admin@onlydust.xyz before payment is triggered.

#### Final tips

* Crypto to exchange wallets = risky → they often reject ecosystem-native USDC
* Use a wallet you control and check regularly
* You can update your info (wallet or PayPal email) at any time before the next payment wave by emailing us

That's it. Proper setup = smooth payments, no headaches.
