### Getting Paid – How to Set Up Your Wallet (and Not Lose Your Funds)

You’re about to receive a Fellowship grant or a project reward through OnlyDust.

That means you’ll get crypto payments (USDC or native tokens), tied to the ecosystem you're contributing to.

Each ecosystem comes with its own network, rules, and currency. So please — read this carefully. Mistakes here can get expensive.

#### Step 1 – Check your ecosystem + currency

Your payment depends on the ecosystem you’re linked to. Here’s the breakdown:

**If you're in the Starknet ecosystem:**

* Payments are made in USDC
* Network: Starknet
* Wallets we recommend you to use: Braavos or Ready (former ArgentX)
* Your wallet must:
  * Be non-custodial (no exchanges because it might result in loss of funds- it happens a lot with exchange when it comes to USDC)
  * Be activated (you must have received at least 1 STRK once)

**If you're in the Stellar ecosystem:**

* Payments are made in USDC
* Network: Stellar
* Wallets we recommend you to use: LOBSTR or any non-custodial Stellar wallet
* Your wallet must:
  * Be activated (i.e. received at least 1 XLM in the past)
  * Have the USDC asset added manually (refer to your wallet’s FAQ)
  * Not be an exchange wallet — those often have internal routing and will reject or lose USDC

**If you're in the Flare ecosystem:**

* Payments are made in native FLR tokens
* Network: Flare
* Wallets we recommend you to use: Use a EVM compatible wallet such as metamask or Rabby on the Flare Network. Please refer to FLR recommandations here [https://flare.network/wallets](https://flare.network/wallets)
* Same rules apply: no exchange wallets, and make sure the wallet is ready to receive FLR

#### Step 2 – Provide your wallet address (correctly)

In the first onboarding form, you’ll be asked to share your wallet address.

You have two options:

1. Use WalletConnect – available only if your wallet provider supports it.
2. Copy-paste your wallet address – the classic way.

_Important: If you go with copy/paste, double-check the address. If you send us the wrong wallet address and the funds go missing, there’s nothing we can do to recover them._

So take 30 seconds to be sure — and if you made a mistake, email us ASAP at [admin@onlydust.xyz](mailto:admin@onlydust.xyz) before payment is triggered.

#### Final tips

* Don't try to get paid to a centralized exchange wallet (Binance, Coinbase etc.) — they don’t support ecosystem-native USDC, and we won't chase down your lost funds.
* Make sure the wallet you give us is one you can access and check regularly.
* You can always update your wallet later by emailing us, but do it before the next payment wave.

That's it. One wallet, properly set up = smooth payments, no headaches.

We did our part — now it’s your turn.
