#### Pay

* Total amount: $30,000 per year, renewable once (2 years in total)
* Pay: $7,500 every quarter, submitted to a committee review (make sure the code has advanced enough during the past 3 months + the quality is still up to expectations)
* 1st pay timing:&#x20;
  *   If you have already started a project with an extensive code base, we can review :

      $7,500 at contract signature&#x20;
  *   If you've not started and want to use this to fund an idea : &#x20;

      $7,500 1 month after contract signature, submitted for review (quantity and quality of the work in this 1 month)&#x20;
