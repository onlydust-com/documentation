<summary>"I would make more money freelancing, the pay is not high enough" </summary>

You're right. If that if this were a freelance contract, the rate would be low. \
But here's the key difference: **this is a grant to fund a project you'd build anyway, not payment for contract work.**\
\
Think of it this way:&#x20;

* If you're already spending evenings/weekends on a side project you're passionate about, this grant gives you â‚¬30k to keep doing exactly that
* It's not about replacing your income, it's about funding your ambition
* The real value compounds: you keep all IP rights for commercial use, get visibility with top AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind), and potentially get flown to SF to meet researchers

If your goal is to maximize hourly rate, freelancing is definitely better. But if you're building something you believe in and want funding without investor dilution or client management, this is designed for that.
