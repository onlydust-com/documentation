# What's in it for you

Here’s what you get if selected for the Impossible Benchmark Program:

* **Your work becomes the new frontier** : your contribution has a direct impact on improving the models & agents of the world's top AI labs (think for example OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, Mistral, ...). &#x20;
* **Invitation to San Francisco** (for top contributors): Meet researchers from top AI labs, share your workflow, and shape how AI learns to code like elite engineers, not just autocomplete.&#x20;
* **$30,000/year grant** (paid quarterly, $7,500 per installment), renewable for up to 2 years, no equity taken, no strings attached beyond the program terms. It’s a grant, pure and simple, to empower you to keep building on YOUR project.&#x20;
* **Full ownership of your code**: You retain all rights. We only ask for a time-bound, exclusive license to use your closed-source project to build AI benchmarks.
* **Zero pressure to “productize”**: This isn’t about building a business. It’s about advancing hard, real-world engineering. If your project solves a meaningful problem and confuses AI, that’s enough.
* **A community of peers:** Join 100 of the world’s most technically rigorous builders, people who code in Rust, C++, Go, embedded systems, compilers, and other domains where correctness, context, and complexity matter more than syntax.
